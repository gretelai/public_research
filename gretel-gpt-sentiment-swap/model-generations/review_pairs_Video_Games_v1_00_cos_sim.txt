Review: No More Heroes was one of my favorite wii games. This game takes everything that works from the first game, cuts off the fat, amps everything up a little and delivers one of the best wii games period. If you enjoy, violence, lightsabers, and humor, get this game.

Review: It is so disappointing that they did not keep the same great gameplay as No More Heroes. The fighting is so slow and awkward. It feels like they were trying to make a more \\"realistic\\" fighting game rather than a fun one. I do not recommend it.
